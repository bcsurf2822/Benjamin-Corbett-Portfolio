  life: "I am a NJ based web developer, that loves looking into the next thing coming in tech and learning new technologies. When I'm not at my desk, I enjoy going to the beach, surfing, skateboarding, spending time with my wife and dog, cooking, hiking, traveling, family, and doing DIY projects around the house.  Before getting into tech I was a commercial scallop fisherman for 12 years.  I've fished in Alaska, Massachusetts and California.  Fishing has taught me countless skills to help me grow as a person, I've made amazing connections, and have seen the best and worst of mother nature.",

  tech: "In 2022, I decided to take my passion for technology to the next level, I started by using online resources to teach myself web-development basics and then joined Parsity online coding bootcamp where I built up skills in React, Redux, MongoDB, Express, and Node.  Since finishing my course work at Paristy, I have been working on developing my skills in NextJS which is where I work on most of my projects today.",
