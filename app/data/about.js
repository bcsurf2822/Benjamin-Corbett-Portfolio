  life: "I am a NJ based web developer, that loves looking into the next thing coming in tech and learning new technologies. When I'm not at my desk, I enjoy going to the beach, surfing, skateboarding, spending time with my wife and dog, cooking, hiking, traveling, family, and doing DIY projects around the house.  Before getting into tech I was a commercial scallop fisherman for 12 years.  I've fished in Alaska, Massachusetts and California.  Being a fisherman has taught me countless skills to help me grow as a person such as leadership, responsibility, and the benefits of hard work. I've had the privelage to work and laugh with some of the best people during our long trips at sea.",

  tech: "In 2022, I decided to take my passion for technology to the next level, I started by using online resources to teach myself web-development basics and then joined Parsity online coding bootcamp where I built up skills in React, Redux, MongoDB, Express, and Node.  Since finishing my course work, I have been working on mastering my skills in NextJS which is where I work on most of my projects today.  I'm currently developing my skill in typescript and Amazon Web Services(AWS)",
