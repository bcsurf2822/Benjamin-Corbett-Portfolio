      <h2>About me...</h2>
      <p>After 12 years in the commercial fishing industry, I decdided to take my interest in technology and web design into a reality.  I started by teaching myself basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through online resources before I took the leap to enroll in a coding bootcamp.  In 2023, I joined Parsity Coding Bootcamp where I developed my skills in React, Redux, MongoDB, Express, and Node.  Since finishing my course work at Paristy, I have been working on developing my skills in NextJS which is where I work on most of my projects today.</p>
      <p>On the side I still enjoy spending time on the ocean or at the beach.  I love traveling to different parts of the world.  I&apos;ve been to Indonesia, Japan, and Europe.   I love to surf, skateboard, practice yoga, paint, go to concerts, and enjoy online poker in my free time</p>
