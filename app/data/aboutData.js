  intro: "I am a Full-Stack Software Developer specializing in building enterprise-grade web applications with modern JavaScript technologies. Currently working at KLoBot Inc., I contribute to AI-powered solutions that integrate with Microsoft 365 and SharePoint ecosystems.",

  techFocus: "My technical expertise spans the full stack: React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Angular on the frontend; C#, .NET, Python, Node.js, and Express.js on the backend; with hands-on experience in Azure cloud services, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and RESTful API design. I'm passionate about performance optimization, secure authentication patterns, and building scalable architectures.",

  journey: "My journey into software began unconventionally while recovering from an injury sustained as a commercial fisherman. Self-teaching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript sparked a passion that led me to Parsity's full-stack bootcamp in 2023, where I mastered modern web development practices, Redux state management, and responsive design patterns.",

  currentFocus: "I'm actively expanding my skill set in AI integration with LangChain and OpenAI APIs, exploring cloud infrastructure with AWS and Azure, and deepening my knowledge of containerization with Docker. I contribute to open-source projects and participate in remote team collaborations through platforms like Chingu.",

  background: "My 12 years as a commercial fisherman across Alaska, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and California instilled critical soft skills: leadership under pressure, adaptability in fast-paced environments, and effective team communication. Outside of coding, I enjoy surfing, camping, DIY home projects, and spending time with my wife and dog."
